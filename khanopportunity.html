		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<ul class="faq">
			<li>
				<h4>Who is eligible?</h4>
				<p>
					This opportunity is for 3rd&ndash;7th grade public school teachers who use Edmodo and who have not previously signed up on Khan Academy.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What is a mission?</h4>
				<p>
					A mission is simply a way on Khan Academy to help learners focus on content that is most meaningful to them.  Each math mission on Khan Academy provides complete coverage of a particular grade level or subject.  For more information, check out this
					<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res/reference-for-coaches/other-reference-materials/a/what-is-a-mission" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send','event', 'highFive', 'externalLinkInFAQ-articleOnKhanAcademy', 'click');">article on Khan Academy.</a>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>How do I choose the right mission for my class?</h4>
				<p>
					In order to be eligible for this program, you will need your students to be working and making progress in their grade-level mission (i.e., if you are a 4th grade teacher, your students will need to make progress in Khan Academy&#39;s 4th grade mission).  However, the great thing about Khan Academy is that learners can also access content outside of their grade-level mission if they need extra support or want to accelerate ahead!
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What is a &ldquo;mission warm-up?&rdquo;</h4>
				<p>
					The mission warm-up will be your students&#39; first experience of Khan Academy once they have selected their grade-level mission.  The mission warm-up will ask students to answer a few math problems.  That information will help Khan Academy&#39;s analytics system to know where it can help the students.  The students will always have the option to say &ldquo;I haven&#39;t learned this yet,&rdquo; if it is a skill that they are unfamiliar with.

				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>How do I know when 10 of my students have achieved 10% of the mission-level skills?</h4>
				<p>
					The easiest way to see whether you have 10 students that have achieved 10% or more of mission-level skills is to look at your class histogram.  You can navigate there easily by going to your coach homepage and then clicking &ldquo;student progress&rdquo; for your classes.  The Y-axis of the histogram shows you how many students have completed what % of the class mission.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>What is the difference between mission-level skills and mission foundations?</h4>
				<p>
					Mission foundations will provide a quick review of prerequisites and help check a learners&#39; preparedness for grade- or subject-level material.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Where do I go if I need help using Khan Academy with my students?</h4>
				<p>
					Khan Academy has created a great online support resource that helps you learn how to get your class started on Khan Academy and shares best practices.  This is a great place to learn more about all the great learner and coach tools that are available as well as to understand the nuts and bolts of how to get your class started!  You can find these resources by going to: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res" onclick="ga('send','event', 'highFive', 'externalLinkInFAQ-coachRes', 'click');">khanacademy.org/coach-res</a>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Where do I go if I have a problem with Khan Academy?</h4>
				<p>
					If you have a problem with Khan Academy, go to their <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send','event', 'highFive', 'externalLinkInFAQ-helpCenter', 'click');">Help Center</a>.  You can type in your questions or report bugs that you are finding as you work on Khan Academy.
